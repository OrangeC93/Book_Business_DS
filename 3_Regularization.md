## Out of sample performance
The difference between in-and out-of-sample R2 is what data is used to fit and what the deviances are calculated on(new data).

Note: All that matters is out-of-sample R2. We dont need to care about in-sample R2, because we can get better numbers simply by adding junk variables and inducing overfit. Using OOS experiments to choose the best model is called cross validation.

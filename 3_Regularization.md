The difference between in- and out-of-sample R2 is what data is used to fit  and what the deviances are calculated on(new data).
all that matters is out-of-sample R2. You donâ€™t care about in-sample R2, because you can get better numbers simply by adding junk variables and inducing overfit. Using OOS experiments to choose the best model is called cross validation.
